# CubeMars AK60-6 Model

This repository contains Arduino codes for the CubeMars AK60-6 motor (This code also works for other AK-series motors). These codes can be calibrated based on your specific use case. Additionally, I have included a PDF documenting the process I followed.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, here are a few important recommendations:

1. **Read the Documentation:**  
   Visit the [official CubeMars article](https://www.cubemars.com/article.php?id=261) for crucial information. Be sure to read the documentation and watch the videos provided.  

2. **Update Motor Parameters:**  
   Update your motor parameters using the file available in the CubeMars Discord channel.
   
3. **Change the Motor Mode:**   
   By using upper computer program, change the motor mode which mode you will use. If you do not, this can be harmful for motor and burn some drivers.

4. **Give the Permission for CAN**   
   By using upper computer program, you should also give the permission for CAN protocol for motors---

### Files Included
